Downloading one file:
az -n 1 -d 2015-12-11: -s :3000000  -m play.google.com,appchina
This means: download 1 apk with the dexdate starting from the 2015-12-11 (inclusive), size up to 3000000 bytes (inclusive) and present on either play.google.com or appchina

---DEFINETLY download smaller files---
az -n 1000 -s 0:100000 -vt 0:0 -o .\benign_AndroZoo1 -t 10

downloads 1000 random apks, size range between 0 and 100KB, virus rating of 0, downloads to subfolder "benign_AndroZoo1", uses 10 process threads

Need API Key from AndroZoo
Need latest.csv from AndroZoo
latest.csv needs to be cleaned (converted to utf-8 encoding? Not sure exactly)

Put key and csv path in .az file in 3 possible locations: the cli folder, the local folder to call az from, the user folder for calling az globally
key={key}
input_file={latest.csv Path}

Need Python 3.8
Need Environment Variables Set (python location and scripts folder)

Need to allow scripts to be used
Get-ExecutionPolicy (shows the setting for scripts)
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned (*safer* way to run scripts that are signed)

Create virtual env for running specific python version
py -3.8 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate

pip azoo:
py -3.8 -m pip install azoo

Use az command from within virtual env

TODO: pyenv-win allows for better version control, may allow for easier usage
